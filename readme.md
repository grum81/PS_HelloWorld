# PocketSprite Hello World App

This is an example app I created to demonstrate some of the basic functionality built into the PocketSprite. It includes functional demonstration of the ÂµGUI, sndmixer and powerbtn_menu libraries. 

 The .bin file can be directly uploaded to the device using the web UI. You can get a pre-compiled version from the Releases section.

 In order to build, you will need to follow the steps found in the [official documentation](http://pocketsprite-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/index.html#software).
